<h2>Jonathan Ysquierdo's cybersecuriy portfolio</h2>  

Transitioning from early challenges in unrelated fields to cybersecurity, I discovered my passion for hands-on technical problem-solving through Houston Community College's Computer Systems Networking - Cybersecurity AAS program. With a strong recent technical GPA of 3.5+, I've built foundational skills across ITNW 1425: Fundamentals of Networking Technologies, ITSC 1307: Unix Operating Systems I, ITMT 1358: Windows Client Operating Systems, and ITMT 1357: Administering Windows Server Operating Systems. These courses equipped me to configure networks, manage Linux/Unix environments, troubleshoot Windows client-server setups, and deploy secure OS configurations, directly aligning with entry-level systems administration and security operations demands.

Deepening my expertise, I excelled in core security courses like ITSY 1342: Information Technology Security, ITSY 2330: Intrusion Detection, ITSY 2401: Firewalls & Network Security, and ITSY 2443: Ethical Hacking Computer System Forensics, earning Dean's List recognition and consistent A's/B's. Hands-on labs in firewall deployment, intrusion monitoring, vulnerability scanning, and digital forensics honed my ability to detect threats, mitigate risks, and conduct incident response, preparing me for SOC analyst or junior security analyst roles. Complementing academics, I've built and troubleshot custom PCs/servers, installed/configured OS environments, and practiced Azure cloud labs, positioning me as a versatile "jack-of-all-trades" ready to contribute immediately in dynamic security operations centers.

<h4>“The human factor is truly security’s weakest link.” – Kevin Mitnick</h4>

Kevin Mitnick’s focus on the human side of cybersecurity strongly shaped how I think about defense. His point that “the human factor is truly security’s weakest link” reminds me that even the best tools, firewalls, and cloud configurations cannot protect an organization if people are not trained and supported to make good decisions, whether that is resisting phishing or not plugging in a random USB from a parking lot. His perspective pushes me to care about both technical controls and user awareness so I can help build environments that stay secure in the real world, not just on paper
In addition to coursework and lab projects, I have built practical experience by competing in National Cyber League, completing CyberXP range exercises, and regularly training on TryHackMe to strengthen my offensive and defensive skills.

Cybersecurity is the starting point of my long-term goal to work in cloud engineering and cloud security. The networking, system administration, and defensive skills I am building now give me the baseline needed to design and protect applications in cloud platforms like Azure and other major providers. As I gain experience in entry-level security roles, I plan to transition into roles focused on cloud infrastructure and cloud security, where I can apply both my security mindset and my interest in scalable, modern technology environments.
